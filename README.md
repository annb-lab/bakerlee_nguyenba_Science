This repo accompanies the research article "Idiosyncratic epistasis leads to global fitness-correlated trends" by Christopher W. Bakerlee†, Alex N. Nguyen Ba†, Yekaterina Shulgina, Jose I. Rojas Echenique, and Michael M. Desai* (2021).

It contains example pipelines and minimal code necessary for:

1. processing of raw sequencing reads into inferred genotype and phenotype data;
2. inference of epistatic model coefficients.
3. analysis for fitness-correlated trends

The code is not expected to be readily functional to the user, as dependencies, paths and hardcoded values would need to be appropriately adjusted.

Raw sequencing reads were uploaded to NCBI SRA under the accession PRJNA815849.

Supplementary files are included with the published research article.
