This repo accompanies the research article "Idiosyncratic epistasis leads to global fitness-correlated trends" by Christopher W. Bakerlee†, Alex N. Nguyen Ba†, Yekaterina Shulgina, Jose I. Rojas Echenique, and Michael M. Desai* (2021).

It contains example pipelines and minimal code necessary for:

    processing of raw sequencing reads into inferred genotype and phenotype data;
    inference of epistatic model coefficients.

The code is not expected to be readily functional to the user, as dependencies, paths and hardcoded values would need to be appropriately adjusted.

Raw sequencing reads were uploaded to NCBI SRA

Supplementary files are included with the published research article.
